Everything you believed had meaning—
every hope, every dream, every moment of happiness—
none of it matters as you lie bleeding on the battlefield.
None of it can change what a speeding rock does to the human body.
We all die.

But does that mean our lives are meaningless?
Does it mean there was no point in being born?
Would you say that of our fallen comrades?
Were their lives meaningless?

No. They were not.

Their memories serve as an example to us all—
the brave, the anguished, the fallen.
Their lives had meaning because we, the living, refuse to forget them.

And as we ride toward certain death,
we trust our successors to do the same for us.

Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield.
When faced with the cruel reality of this world,
my soldiers push forward.

My soldiers scream.
My soldiers rage.
My soldiers fight.
